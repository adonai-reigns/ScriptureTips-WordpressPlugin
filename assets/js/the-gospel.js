The writings were stored and studied as separate scrolls within religious libraries. During the first 300 years after Christ's resurrection, churches established formal lists to identify which writings should be considered officially inspired by God, to distinguish them from other sacred writings that were written by people whose spirit was not recognised as being representative of God.</dd> <dt>Heaven</dt> <dd>A spiritual realm of reality which is known by faith, in which God resides. Christianity teaches that Jesus came to earth to demonstrate God's true nature so that we might recognise Him in the heavenly realm and follow Him. Christians are called to follow Jesus, to live in a way that honours Him so that we will serve as effective ambassadors of God, becoming a vessel for His Holy Spirit to operate in the world.</dd> <dt>Atonement</dt> <dd>The putting right of things that are wrong. In context of a person coming to know the truth about sin and repentance, this means understanding why the sinfulness is bad, why we became that way, and why God is willing to forgive us for repenting of it.</dd> </dl> </div> <div class="transcript right"> <dl> <dt>Holy</dt> <dd>Without sin or fault, beyond reproach.</dd> <dt>Messiah / Christ</dt> <dd>The only-begotten Son of God, born to a mother who was pure and virgin. He was raised under the shadow of The Holy Spirit and heaven's close watch, so that He was presented without blemish to receive all honour, glory and praise as The One who is a perfect example of God's intention for mankind. His character is to love and heal, to judge without partiality, and to be the fullness of God in human form. Although His human body was executed 2,000 years ago, He reigns forevermore in heaven so that we may know Him and represent Him on earth while heaven continues to serve Him for an eventual return in glory, afterwhich sin will never again rule humankind.</dd> <dt>Original Sin</dt> <dd>Adam introduced sin to a world that knew no sin, by choosing to disobey God's commandment. Adam could never escape the shame and guilt for what he had done. His relationship with God suffered, he doubted God's true nature, and subsequently all humans become tainted as they are impacted by the philosophy of a world controlled by fear: not being able to fully trust and know God. The corruption of hnumankind's once impeccable knowledge of God has spread from this one man's Original Sin, to all.</dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div class="page double" title="The Great Commission" id="the-great-commission" data-first-side="right"> <h2>The Great Commission</h2> <div class="image" style="background-image:url('//static.adonai-reigns.life/the-gospel/20191017-mobile/the-great-commission.jpg')"></div> <div class="transcripts"> <div class="transcript left"> <blockquote> <p>God gave me grace to lay a foundation, like a skilled master builder.
