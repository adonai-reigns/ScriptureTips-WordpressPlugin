# Adonai-Reigns Wordpress Plugin

A Wordpress plugin to enhance websites that reference bible quotes often.

[Download the latest version: 1.0.2](https://static.adonai-reigns.life/wp/adonai-reigns.life-1.0.2.zip). (Released 2020-02-24, 26.7MB .zip).

It scans each content block, looking for patterns that look like bible references, then converts those references into links, making a tooltip appear when the mouse hovers the link.

Clicking the link takes the user to read more at www.biblegateway.com.

Tooltip content is stored in the database, and database queries are cached for fastest performance.
